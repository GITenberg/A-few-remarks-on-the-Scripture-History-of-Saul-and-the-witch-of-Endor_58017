<p style="text-align: center"><i>To all those who love the Lord
Jesus Christ in Sincerity</i>.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">BELOVED</span>,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is your mercy the divine Spirit
is the glorifier of Jesus; that he has set him forth in his word
as the Christ of God; what he is, what he has done, and what he
has graciously said to his people.&nbsp; This is the work of our
faith, to receive as we need, these things, all the way to
heaven.</p>
<p>The person of Jesus is the delight of the Father, the glory of
heaven, and the foundation of the Church, considered as God-man
Mediator.&mdash;The glories of his person is revealed in the
word, but we must die to see them in full perfection, and no
doubt that will be an heaven worth dying for: but blessed be God
we are not wholly in the dark about these excellencies, so runs
the promise, <i>They </i><a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span><i>shall all know me</i>, <i>from the
least to the greatest</i>.&mdash;His person is truly blessed; his
love is immutable; his work is honorable and glorious, exactly
suited to all the necessities, of his people.&nbsp; His covenant
engagements, his precious offices, his sweet titles and
characters, the Father&rsquo;s gracious acceptance of the work he
accomplished, and to which he had called and appointed him.&nbsp;
These, and a thousand more interesting points, are set forth as
matters of our faith, and the food of our souls.&nbsp; His
everlasting righteousness is our justification, his precious
blood-shedding is our atonement, and his prevalent intercession
at the Father&rsquo;s right-hand, is the basis of our hope, and
the ground of our acceptance.&mdash;I say again, my dear friends
in Jesus, what a mercy!&nbsp; This is our refuge, our remedy, our
joy, our triumph, our present and eternal all: and that we have
the most important evidence of interest in these capital
blessings, by being led from every other refuge; and under a
sense, a daily view of our need, we are enabled to fly for a
refuge, to lay hold on this hope; nor can we have a pain, a
sorrow, a cross, a misery of any kind, from sin, Satan or the
world, but the holy Spirit designs thereby really to endear the
Lord Jesus to us, as he is revealed in the word.&nbsp; There is
another most blessed consideration for our faith, viz. What Jesus
has graciously said to his people, in all the precious
declarations of the Father&rsquo;s love; the evidence he has
given of this in the gift of the dear Son, to <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>obey, suffer,
and die&mdash;the declarative evidence of his own love, in his
willingness to accomplish the work of redemption; and blessing
his people with the gift of the holy Spirit, as the principal
evidence of interest in his love and work.&nbsp; His precious
invitations to poor, needy, helpless, lost, wandering, undone
sinners, who being in the least imaginable degree convinced of
their state, they are invited to him, with the most comfortable
assurance of salvation; which assurance <i>of</i>, and <i>to</i>
faith, will, in due time, produce the comfortable assurance of
sense.&nbsp; His promises are exceeding glorious&mdash;hence the
Church declared, after a beautiful, tho&rsquo; enigmatical
description of her Beloved, <i>His mouth is most sweet</i>.&nbsp;
The promises are very precious, yea, the Apostle calls them
<i>exceeding precious</i>&mdash;they are exactly adapted to our
cases, let them be what they may: if thirsting for the
consolations of the Spirit, Jesus says, <i>I will pour water on
him</i>, <i>and floods on the dry ground</i>.&nbsp; If ready to
give up all, having waited long to little purpose, he says,
<i>The vision is for an appointed time</i>, <i>at the end it will
speak</i>.&nbsp; If a soul is groaning under guilt, he says, <i>I
will he merciful to your unrighteousness</i>, <i>and your sins
and iniquities I will remember no more</i>.&nbsp; If we feel our
sins too strong for us, he promises he will subdue them.&nbsp; If
we are made sensible of our backsliding, he says, <i>I will heal
your backslidings</i>.&nbsp; If in great difficulties, and we
know not which way to get out of them, he says, <i>I will bring
the blind by a way they </i><a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span><i>know not</i>: <i>I will guide thee
with mine eye</i>.&nbsp; If harrassed by the Devil, he promises
to <i>bruise him under our feet shortly</i>.&nbsp; If complaining
of hardness of heart, he says, <i>I will give you a new
one</i>&mdash;and if full of fears, he declares he will be <i>an
hiding place in every storm</i>; and if we feel as if we were
forsaken of God; and are actually forsaken of friends, relatives,
acquaintance, and both professor and possessor shun us; and
suppose every ray of sensible comfort gone, yet, he cannot, will
not leave or forsake you; for he hath said, <i>I will never</i>,
<i>never</i>, <i>leave you</i>: <i>I will never</i>, <i>no</i>,
<i>never</i>, <i>no never</i>, <i>forsake you</i>! for so the
learned say it is in the original, not less than five times
mentioned.&nbsp; How sweet the thought!&mdash;so that we may
confidently sing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The soul that on Jesus bath lean&rsquo;d for
repose,<br />
He can not, he will not forsake to his foes;<br />
That soul though all Hell should endeavor to shake,<br />
He&rsquo;ll never, no never, no never, forsake!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he is not a man that he should lie, nor the son of man,
that he should repent.&nbsp; Let our faith plead these things,
and may we rejoice in him who is the faithful God&mdash;he never
can leave or forsake his dear Children, his Bride, his jewels,
his crown, his honour, his glory, his own flesh and blood.&nbsp;
This is our security and our triumph.&nbsp; His love cannot
change; his nature is immutable; his purposes cannot be broken;
the bond of union cannot <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>be dissolved; he is one with them, he
is in them, and they are engraven on his heart, on his arms, and
on the palms of his hands; and he has sworn, <i>Because</i>, or
<i>As I live you shall live also</i>.&nbsp; Yet there may be some
apparent forsakings, these are chiefly imaginary; yet they have
caused these sad complaints&mdash;<i>Why hidest thou thy
face</i>, <i>O Lord</i>?&nbsp; Zion said, <i>The Lord hath
forsaken me&mdash;my God hath forgotten me</i>!&nbsp; The Lord
may depart from his people, in the suspensions of his keeping
hand; and the light of his countenance, the sense of his favour,
and the divine comforts of his spirit&mdash;this may be seen in
the sad tale of the fall, of the children of God, especially in
the history of Sampson, of whom it is written, that he went out
to shake himself, as at other times, and he wist not that the
Lord was departed from him: the Lord may seem as if he had
forsaken his people when he delays answering prayer; when the
soul is shut up for a season; when sin prevails; when no power is
felt under the word; when providences are dark; when temptations
are strong; when the Church is under long persecution; and when
distress abound.&nbsp; Thus we may be partially forsaken; but
faith can still triumph in this&mdash;<i>What shall separate us
from the love of Christ</i>?&nbsp; David still loved his Absalom,
though he refused him the sight of his face.&nbsp; The loss of
the light of God&rsquo;s countenance, loudly proclaims the
direful effects of the believer&rsquo;s sin, sloth, and
unbelief&mdash;O! for grace <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>to fly from sin as from the face of a
Serpent&mdash;O! for grace to cleave to Jesus continually.&nbsp;
But the Lord may be said to leave a man, when he withdraws his
sustaining, creative, providential hand, as in the case of some
who are lunatic; of others who push into dreadful crimes, and
suffer for them; and of others, who are left to their own pride
and despair, and who rush headlong, by their own hands, into an
awful eternity.&nbsp; It is a mercy for a natural man to be kept
by the almighty power of God, even as the God of nature.&nbsp;
The Lord may be said to leave a people, when they have slighted
the Gospel, rejected his servants, despised his ordinances, and
wholly cast out his messages of love to his people.&nbsp; This we
all know was the case with the Jews, which is to be seen to this
day: God has given them up to their own blindness, pride,
prejudice, and enmity; and no doubt they will remain so till the
fulness of the Gentiles be come in.&nbsp; Hence he has said, <i>I
will drive them out of my house</i>.&nbsp; <i>Yea</i>, <i>woe is
to them when I depart from them</i>.&nbsp; <i>Your sin
remaineth</i>.&nbsp; <i>Behold your house is left unto you
desolate</i>, <i>until ye shall say</i>, <i>blessed is he that
cometh in the name of the Lord</i>.&nbsp; But finally; the Lord
has left some individuals to themselves, who have come into a
profession, and who have, uncalled, claimed the Lord as theirs;
who have been awfully proud, arrogant, lovers of themselves,
heady, high minded, and cruelly envious of others; whose hearts
were never truly humbled; <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>whose enmity was never slain; whose
secret prejudice was never subdued; nor were such taught out of
either the Law, the Gospel, or affliction: such may have
wonderful talents, but no love of God, of Christ, or the Spirit;
no real love to the word of God, the house of God, the people of
God, or the operations of the grace of God.&nbsp; Such may make a
fair shew in the flesh, for a season; may be useful in some
external things to others, as the scaffolding to a building,
which will be taken away when the building is compleat; and if
not immediately by death, yet will, sooner or later, take offence
and stumble at the word, leave their profession, find their gifts
wither; hide that talent in a napkin; mount the scorner&rsquo;s
chair; go from bad to worse; stab religion in its vitals, and are
by and by, given up to a <i>fearful looking for of judgment and
fiery indignation</i>.&nbsp; Such awful characters there have
been, and it would be well if the world did not groan with many
at the present time.&nbsp; Such cannot be said to fall from grace
received, alas, they had none&mdash;but only from a presumptuous
confidence, a feigned faith, a false zeal, and an hypocritical
hope; and surely nobody in their right mind, can call these
things Grace, however God makes use of them for a season, and
then leaves them to their own heart&rsquo;s pride and cruelty;
and the awful source of such things is, in general, <i>black
despair</i>.&nbsp; This was partly the sad case of SAUL, which I
now present to my friends, that <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>the affecting story may excite fear,
and self-examination; gratitude and praise for distinguishing
grace and mercy.&nbsp; Doubtless much has been and may be said,
in commendation of some actions in Saul&rsquo;s life, but the
review of his religious character is truly sad, nor can any one
suppose, for a single moment, he ever possessed the grace of God
in truth; for surely that grace saves a soul from the curse of
the Law, the guilt of sin, the damnation of hell, and the power
of Satan: converting grace saves us from the world, self, and a
form of godliness; the grace of faith saves from damning
unbelief; the grace of hope from wretched despair; and the grace
of love from the carnal enmity of the heart; leads us to love
God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit; teaches us to love his word and
ways, and to love all that love Jesus, who bear his image, and
serve him in godly sincerity.&nbsp; But none of these marks of
the elect were found in Saul: not <i>faith</i>, because he daily
manifested his intention to destroy the promised Messiah, who was
David&rsquo;s offspring, as well as David&rsquo;s Lord; nor
<i>hope</i>, for he died in awful despair: nor <i>love</i>, for
his soul was filled with carnal entity against the love of God;
nor access to God; nor a spirit of supplication; nor the grace of
patience; nor humility; nor resignation to the will of God; and
being destitute of those things, his end was according to his
works.&nbsp; He was a slave to his sin, but God&rsquo;s children
are set at liberty from these things, that they should not serve
sin; <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>and
can there be greater sin in the sight of God than envy, hatred,
and malice in the heart against the children of God?
impossible!</p>
<p>This poor unhappy man was the son of Kish, a Benjamite.&nbsp;
The children of Israel, to be like the nations around them,
loudly called out for a King, which God gave in his anger and
took away in his wrath.&nbsp; Samuel was appointed to anoint
Saul; he then assembled the Hebrews to receive their new king;
the people shouted, and wished him joy.&nbsp; A spirit of
prophecy fell on him at times, which astonished many, but it does
not appear to have been in a covenant way, so that no one appears
to have reaped any benefit from his talent.&nbsp; Coming to the
kingdom, God furnished him with natural abilities for the
government of the people.&nbsp; Hence it is said, <i>God gave him
another heart</i>&mdash;not the new heart and the right spirit he
has promised his people, but a mind capable of managing the
affairs of a kingdom.&nbsp; Soon after this advancement, Saul
distinguished himself in some very great exploits, but fell an
awful victim to his pride, which was manifested in his envying
David, whose fame began to spread among his people.&nbsp; <i>Who
can stand before envy</i>?&nbsp; After God had so particularly
honoured David, Saul&rsquo;s sun set at noon day, while light was
rising on David, never to go dawn.&nbsp; The enmity of Saul was
great indeed, which set him upon the awful act of murder; this
infernal intention <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>he prosecuted till the last stage of his life, and
finding David had taken shelter among the Philistines, he gave
over thoughts of getting him destroyed.&nbsp; About the year of
the world three thousand and forty nine, the Philistines invaded
his kingdom, and encamped in the very heart of it, perhaps at the
very time he was troubling the afflicted David.&nbsp; Saul now
fell into the deepest distress of mind; his measure was now,
nearly filled up, and a righteous God was now about to take
vengeance on him for his disobedience in the matter of the
Amalekites; his horrid cruelty in the murder of the priests and
their families; and his enmity to David, of course to
David&rsquo;s God.&nbsp; Despair seizing his soul and preying on
his spirits, he first calls on God, but most probably not in the
appointed way; nor did he wait God&rsquo;s answer, but fled from
him in the pride of his heart, and applied to the devil and his
daughter, the Witch of Endor, for relief to his mind.&nbsp; Sad
refuge, miserable comforters indeed!&nbsp; He wanted to see and
speak with Samuel the Prophet, whom he had neglected and
disobeyed in his life time, and therefore as God was departed
from him, nor would answer him, he was determined, in defiance of
Jehovah, to seek redress, from the Devil.&nbsp; The Witch, no
doubt, retiring to another apartment than that in which Saul was,
used her spells and enchantments, to bring up the pretended
Samuel, who first told her who her client was, which made her cry
out, Thou art Saul, come to me in disguise.&nbsp; <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>After Saul
had assured her no harm should come to her, of course she had
nothing to fear from man, and no doubt much conversation took
place, which is not recorded, between the Witch and Saul.&nbsp;
But he being in haste, asked her what she saw when she had used
her spells.&nbsp; She answered and said, I saw gods ascending out
of the earth: the learned say it is not a plural, but ought to be
rendered a god&mdash;Angels, and Magistrates used to be so
called.&nbsp; This idea of the singular number is supported by
the question, What form is <i>he</i> of?&nbsp; And the Witch
said, An old man with a mantle.&nbsp; She did not say she saw
Samuel, nor did the Ghost say it was; and it is queried whether
Saul saw the spectre at all; but he bowed himself to the ground;
perhaps to hear what the spectre had to say, as their speech was
called muttering; or if Saul saw the figure, then the
conversation that passed is recorded, at least part of it.&nbsp;
The spectre pretends he was Samuel in a glorified state; and that
Saul had disquieted him.&nbsp; He told him that Saul and his sons
should be with him the next day.&nbsp; He then brought up some of
his sins, and charged them home to his conscience, in order to
drive him into desperation: this made Saul faint in the house of
the Witch, and he could scarcely be prevailed on to take any
refreshment.&nbsp; He then travelled all night to his
troops.&nbsp; When the battle was fought, the Hebrews were
routed, but they maintained a running fight till they came to
Gilboa, <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>where the enemy overpowered them; three of Saul&rsquo;s
sons were slain; Saul being pressed by the enemy be begged his
Armour-Bearer to run him through with his sword, which he
refusing, Saul took his owe sword and fell upon it, and went to
his place.&nbsp; The subject of enquiry is the Circumstance of
his application to a Witch to raise up Samuel.&nbsp; Many have
been, and still are of opinion, that it was really Samuel the
Prophet, the man of God; the principal reason why even some good
men are of this opinion is, simply, on account of the
prophecy.&nbsp; The question with them is, how could Satan
foretel what would happen to Saul?&nbsp; I shall therefore shew
the very important reasons why I think the appearance was not the
true Samuel.&nbsp; 2ndly, shew the possibility of Satan knowing
what would shortly befal Saul.&nbsp; 3rdly, produce the testimony
of some of the best writers on this subject.</p>
<p>The whole circumstance we find recorded in the first book of
Samuel, 28th chap. which I humbly conceive, if attentively read,
and well weighed in the mind, it will appear evident that the
spectre which appeared to Saul, could <i>not</i> be the true
Samuel.&nbsp; I state my reason to those friends of mine who are
not clear in their judgments on this subject, and request their
attention to the following observations:</p>
<p><i>First</i>, that it is believed that the woman at <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Endor was
really a Witch; this is not doubted by any; and surely every
person who is conversant with their Bible, must remember that
Jehovah forbid, on pain of Death, the practice of Witchcraft,
Divination, Necromancy, or consulting the dead.&nbsp; Hence the
command, <i>Thou shalt not suffer a Witch to live</i>.&nbsp; As
they rejected the Most High, and sought to devils, the sworn foes
of God and his Saints; therefore it is absurd to suppose that God
would countenance such a practice in Saul&rsquo;s
case.&mdash;<i>Second</i>, It is evident God has absolutely
refused to answer Saul, and if he got any answer from the other
world at all, God did <i>not</i> send it; then Satan <i>must</i>
either send it, or come himself.&mdash;<i>Third</i>, It is
declared God would not answer him by Prophets; and we all know
Samuel was a Prophet; then it could be no true prophet of
God.&mdash;<i>Fourth</i>, The scriptures declare that Saul died
for his transgressions, which he committed against the Lord; and
also for asking counsel of one that hath a familiar spirit, to
enquire of it, and enquired not of the <i>Lord</i>, therefore he
slew him.&mdash;1st Chron. 10th chapter.&nbsp; Let this divine
testimony suffice that he did not enquire of the Lord&mdash;then
he must have enquired of the Devil.&mdash;<i>Fifth</i>, We have
no authority to believe that it ever was in the power of the
Devil, or his Daughter, a Witch, to disturb a Saint in heaven; or
to raise up a body from the grave.&mdash;<i>Sixth</i>, To take
them out of the hands of Christ, or the bosom of his
felicity.&mdash;<i>Seventh</i>, <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>Had it been the true Samuel, he would
not have said he came up from the earth, but rather that he came
from above.&mdash;<i>Eighth</i>, No Believer can for a single
moment, admit that a glorified saint could be subject to hellish
enchantment.&mdash;<i>Ninth</i>, Nor is it reasonable to suppose
that God would answer Saul by a dead prophet, when he refused to
answer him by a living one; or that God would send a Prophet from
heaven upon such an errand as this at the motion of a
Witch.&mdash;<i>Tenth</i>, Nor would Samuel, the true Prophet,
have admitted such worship and homage to be paid to him as the
Devil did.&mdash;<i>Eleventh</i>, If it had been the true
Prophet, he would have reproved him for the sin of asking counsel
of a Witch, as well as other sins he accused him
of.&mdash;<i>Twelfth</i>, Had it been the true Samuel he would
have advised him to go by humble confession to the Lord, and wait
on him for pardoning mercy.</p>
<p>From these observations, I think, it cannot be reasonably
supposed to be Samuel, the true Prophet of God.&nbsp; That there
have been appearances of spectres I doubt not, but I cannot
suppose for a moment, that they are the real souls of the
departed, but either their guardian angels or infernal spirits,
sent on errands we know nothing of in this lower world; but this
I leave, and only remark that in this case of the wretched,
despairing Saul, that Satan, with whom the Witch of Endor was
very familiar, could easily transform himself into a grave <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>old man, with
a mantle, when the scriptures declare he can transform himself
into an Angel of Light, which must be a greater work.&nbsp; It is
evident he is now, and has been for many years, worshipped by
Heathens, in many forms, witness the idols which are made and
adored abroad, in which form, no doubt, Satan has often appeared
to his familiars.&nbsp; As to his being called Samuel, many who
have been possessed of the devil are called prophets, as well as
many who are destitute of grace have been called christians; but
what appears to stagger some of my friends the most is, how Satan
could know future events, and predict them to Saul.&nbsp; But
surely there was no such a great mystery in this, when it was
well known the evil spirits, in the oracles of the heathen, and
in others, have told future events.&nbsp; Besides, Satan well
knew the numbers and strength of the enemies that came up against
Saul&rsquo;s army.&nbsp; No doubt Satan has much to do in a field
of Battle.&nbsp; Likewise Satan well knew that God had left Saul,
and could then easily tell that it must go bad with him and his
armies.&nbsp; There wanted no conjurer to tell that, nor need
Samuel come from heaven to predict it.&nbsp; Balaam, the wizard,
who went several times to consult the devil about cursing the
children of Israel, was obliged to turn Prophet, and foretold the
coming of Christ, and the glories of his kingdom; the destruction
of the enemies of the Church, and his own awful end, <i>I shall
see him</i>, <i>but not now</i>&mdash;<a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>(that is, when he comes to
judgment.)&nbsp; <i>I shall behold him</i>, <i>but not
nigh</i>&mdash;(when he lifted up his eyes in hell).&nbsp;
Besides, God often permits Satan, as the Prince of the Power of
the Air, to foresee the ruin of men, as in the case of
Ahab.&nbsp; See 1st. Kings, 22nd Chap. xx, xxii verses; and
Satan, in a man, may predict his own ruin, or the ruin of
others.&nbsp; This may be seen in the case of Haman, in the book
of Esther, 6th Chap. xiii, xiv verses.&nbsp; But what was the
prediction of the Devil in Samuel&rsquo;s appearance?&nbsp;
<i>Thou and thy sons shall be with me to-morrow</i>.&nbsp; If
this was the Soul of the true Samuel, he never could have said
this, for Saul could not associate with the Lord&rsquo;s children
in heaven, seeing he lived and died a murderer; nor could his
son, Jonathan have been with him in heaven, seeing he was a lover
of the truth, and a servant of the Lord; and though they both
died in the same field, they could not go to the same
place.&nbsp; So that this spectre&rsquo;s prediction was wrong;
and if it was supposed to be Samuel&rsquo;s body brought up from
the grave, and the Prophecy was, he should be in the grave
to-morrow; neither was this true, for the battle was not fought
for some days after, and it was a considerable time before Saul
was buried in the grave, as you will find in the close of the
31st Chap.&nbsp; Besides, Samuel was buried at Ramah, and Saul
was buried at Jabesh.&nbsp; Thus the prediction of the Devil was
not true; nor did all Saul&rsquo;s sons die together, for some
lived along time after his death.</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>I shall
now produce the testimony of some learned and pious men, whose
opinions appear to be truly scriptural.</p>
<p>Bishop <i>Hall</i> remarks on this subject: &ldquo;Why should
God answer that man by dreams, who had resisted him waking?&nbsp;
Why should he answer him by Urim, that had slain his
Priests?&nbsp; Why should he answer him by Prophets, who hated
the Father of Prophets?&nbsp; Unto what mad spirit are men driven
by despair!&mdash;if you will not answer <i>Satan</i>
shall.&nbsp; Could Saul be so ignorant as to think that magic had
power over God&rsquo;s deceased saints, either to raise them up,
or call them down from their rest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. <i>Smith</i>, who published his comment on the Bible in
1735, observes, &ldquo;Many controversies have been about
Samuel&rsquo;s apparition, but I am entirely of opinion that it
was neither in the Devil&rsquo;s, or the Witch&rsquo;s power to
raise up the true Samuel, to make him appear there; it was
nothing but mere deceit and collusion of the Devil, whom God
sometimes permits to do strange actions, for the ruin and
destruction of those who give credit thereto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The truly learned Mr. <i>Poole</i>, in his works remarks on
the 13th verse of the chapter&mdash;&ldquo;And the king said unto
her, Be not afraid, for what sawest thou?&nbsp; And the woman
said unto Saul, I saw <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>gods ascending out of the
earth&mdash;or a god, a divine person, glorious, and full of
majesty, exceeding not only mortal men, but common ghosts.&nbsp;
She useth the plural number, either after the manner of the
Hebrew language, which commonly useth that word of one person, or
after the language and custom of the heathens; but the whole
coherence shews that it was but one, for Saul desired but one;
and he enquires for, and the woman answers only of one, as if it
came from the place of the dead.&nbsp; The woman pretended, and
Saul, upon her suggestion believed indeed, that it was Samuel,
and so many Popish and other writers conceived; but that it was
<i>not</i> Samuel, is sufficiently evident.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
argument of this good man I have interspersed in a foregoing
page.</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Matthew Henry&rsquo;s</i> opinion may be ascertained
from the few remarks extracted from his notes on this
chapter.&mdash;&ldquo;Since Saul can discern no comfort, neither
in heaven or earth, he resolves to knock at the gates of hell,
and see if any there will befriend him and give him advice.&nbsp;
Saul (who we may suppose was kept at a distance in the next room)
bid her not to be afraid of him, but go on with the operation,
and enquired, What she saw?&nbsp; O, saith the woman, <i>I saw
gods ascending out of the earth</i>; <i>i.e.</i> a
spirit&mdash;angels were called gods, because they were spiritual
beings.&nbsp; Poor gods that ascend out of the earth.&nbsp; But
she speaks the language of <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>the Heathen, who had their infernal
deities, and had them in veneration.&nbsp; Saul came in disguise
to Satan, and Satan knew him well.&nbsp; Satan came in disguise
to Saul, but Saul could not discern him.&mdash;It was cold
comfort this evil spirit gave to Saul, and is manifestly intended
to drive him to despair and self murder.&nbsp; He upbraided him
with three things, tho&rsquo; he had been the seducer; and then
he foretold his approaching ruin, which any body could have done
as well as Satan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bishop <i>Patrick</i> observes, &ldquo;It is not in the power
of witches, to disturb the rest of good men, or bring them back
into the world when they please; nor would the true Samuel have
acknowledged such a power in magical hearts, but to Saul this was
a proper device of Satan, to draw veneration from him, to possess
him with an opinion of the divination, and so to rivet him in the
Devil&rsquo;s interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. <i>Haweis</i> also remarks&mdash;&ldquo;It is incredible
that the Devil should have any power over the souls of the
righteous; nor can we conceive God would, to countenance such an
abomination, suffer the holy Prophet to appear: the soul which
was in heaven could not come up out of the earth, nor the
glorified spirit be troubled as this apparition pretended, much
less could Samuel say, Saul should be with him to-morrow, whose
impenitent end, gives no hope of his happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>Mr.
<i>Mason</i>, a very spiritual writer, expresses himself thus
concerning Saul&rsquo;s conduct; &ldquo;See how a sin-hardened
soul acts&mdash;not like David, who goes to the Lord with an
humbled heart, a broken spirit, a sorrowful cry, <i>O Lord pardon
mine iniquity</i>, <i>for it is great</i>!&mdash;But like Saul,
who applied to the Devil for relief, for the Lord was departed
from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. <i>Brown</i>, in his Self-interpreting Bible, says,
&ldquo;And when the woman saw Samuel, that is, the Devil in his
likeness.&nbsp; Satan hath no power over the souls of glorified
saints.&nbsp; God would never give him any to countenance
consulting of Devils.&nbsp; Samuel&rsquo;s soul had not to come
out of the earth, nor would he have said that Saul should be with
him to-morrow, for it is not probable the battle was fought on
that day&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The able and learned Dr. <i>Gill</i> observes, on the 15th
verse, &ldquo;And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted
me to bring me up?&nbsp; This makes it a clear case that this was
not the true Samuel&mdash;his soul was at rest in Abraham&rsquo;s
bosom, and it was not in the power of men or devils to disquiet
it&mdash;nor would he have talked of his being brought up, but
rather of his coming down, had it been really he, much less would
he have acknowledged that he was brought up by Saul, by means of
a Witch, and the help of the Devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>The
late truly deep-taught scriptorian, Mr. <i>W. Huntington</i>, in
his Epistles of Faith, acknowledges this history had once puzzled
him, as many professors had told him it was really Samuel the
Prophet, that the Witch of Endor raised; but adds, For my part I
cannot believe it, for God has promised that his people shall be
gathered in peace, and that their bodies shall rest in their
beds; and I cannot think that it is in the power of the Devil to
break the promise of God; for the wicked <i>cease</i> from
troubling, and in that state, the weary are at rest.&nbsp; If
Satan can bring a soul out of Paradise, who departed in the
faith, and raise a body out of the grave, who was once a temple
of the Holy Ghost, he is not only the God of this world, but a
rifler of the next.&nbsp; However, Jesus Christ is the
resurrection and the life, and he is too jealous of his honour to
give it to an enemy.&nbsp; The woman cried out, <i>I see gods
ascending</i>, when she saw the Devil come up, as an angel of
light&mdash;and I do not wonder at it, for I dare say she had
never seen her sweet-heart in the rays of an angel, or with the
gravity of a Prophet before.&nbsp; Be not offended at the word
sweet-heart, God says they sacrificed to devils, and went a
whoring after devils.&nbsp; See 37th Deut. and 17th Levit.</p>
<p>One of our best and most evangelical preachers and writers, (I
mean the excellent Dr. <i>Hawker</i>) in his notes on this
chapter, remarks, &ldquo;The great enemy of souls might be
permitted to personate the <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>departed Prophet, as such he appears
to Saul&rsquo;s view like Samuel.&nbsp; That it could not be
Samuel himself, is I think, evident from other
considerations.&nbsp; Neither Satan nor his instruments can have
power over glorified saints; neither could the soul of Samuel be
said to come up out of the earth, when we know that the spirits
of just men made perfect, are with the Lord.&nbsp; Neither, had
it been Samuel, would he have told him of the awful event about
to take place, without following it up with advice to repent,
instead of driving him to despair, and thereby forming a
temptation to self-murder.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
